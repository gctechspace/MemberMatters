* Admin Interface for managing all aspects of the system.
* Webcam snapshots, last swipes, who's on site, and other member tools.
* Full "Memberbucks" Support for on site payments via tapping a membership card.
* And many more! Look through the screenshots below or setup your own instance to play around.

The following features have now been deprecated and will be removed in a future release:
* Xero integration

## Getting Started
See the [getting started](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) instructions for how to run the MemberMatters software for your 
organisation. Once you've finished installing MemberMatters, your should read the [post installation steps](/docs/POST_INSTALL_STEPS.md) for important instructions on setting up and customising your instance.

### Compatibility
Currently, MemberMatters is only officially supported on the latest LTS release of Ubuntu Server. Being Docker, you should be able to run it on various other platforms, but minimal support will be available. We currently offer AMD64, ARM64 and ARMv7 builds on Dockerhub.

## Updates and Releases
The official changelog is available on the website [here](https://membermatters.org/CHANGELOG). You will also find each release [here](https://github.com/membermatters/MemberMatters/releases) on GitHub.

## Getting Started (Developers)
### Pre-Commit Hooks
We use husky and lint-staged to manage pre commit hooks. The first thing you should do is run `npm install` in this 
directory. This installs and configures the pre commit hooks automatically. After doing this, you should see them run
when you try to commit a file (for example, with `git commit -m "update thing"`).

### Vue.js JavaScript frontend 
Please see the [readme](frontend/README.md) file inside the `frontend` folder. This folder contains all of the source
code and other assets needed by the frontend.

### Django Python backend
Please see the [readme](memberportal/README.md) file inside the `memberportal` folder. This folder contains all of the source
code and other assets needed by the backend.

### Development tip (dev server proxy)
The Vue.js (Quasar) frontend and Django backend run different dev servers on different ports. Due to
this you will run into issues with sharing cookies etc across the different URIs. To get around 
this, the webpack dev server has been setup to proxy all requests to `/api` to `localhost:8000` so 
you'll need to make sure the django dev server is running there.

## Door, Interlock & Vending Machine Resources
This software was developed out of HSBNE Inc (Australia's largest makerspace!). As part of our access control system (including doors and machine interlocks) we have developed a set of standard hardware components and firmware that is compatible with MemberMatters. Below is a list of useful resources for building your own hardware using off the shelf components. Once the hardware is built and firmware is flashed, you can add them to MemberMatters for a complete access system and/or billing system for physical purchases.

* [HSBNE Access Control Firmware](https://github.com/HSBNE/AccessControl) - Arduino based software that runs on ESPxx devices that run each of our interlock/door controllers.
